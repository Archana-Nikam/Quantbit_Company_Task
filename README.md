Task #13: Binary Search Problem
Overview
This repository contains the solution for Task #13 from the Python Developer Intern assessment by Quantbit Technologies. The task involves implementing a Binary Search Algorithm to efficiently find the index of a target element in a sorted array.Binary search is an optimized searching algorithm that operates on sorted data and reduces the search space by half in each iteration, achieving a time complexity of O(log n).

Problem Statement
Write a Python function to perform binary search on a sorted array.
The function should take two inputs: a sorted list and the target element to search for.
If the target element exists in the array, return its index.
If the target element does not exist, return a message indicating that it was not found.

Solution Description
The solution includes:
A Python function binary_search that takes a sorted array and a target element as inputs.
The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the middle index, compare the target element, and adjust the search space accordingly.
The result is either the index of the target element or a message stating that the target is not found in the array.

How to Run the Code
Clone the repository to your local system:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
cd <repository-folder>
Open the Python file (binary_search.py) in your code editor.
Run the script using any Python interpreter (Python 3.x recommended):
bash
Copy code
python binary_search.py
